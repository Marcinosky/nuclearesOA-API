Introduction

Nucleares is a dynamic, in-depth simulator. Rather than the “plug in numbers and play,” there are so many variables in Nucleares that no two playthroughs are ever likely to be the same. Even when repeating steps verbatim. To master the game is to master the concepts—the ability to take in all the data presented to you, conceptually understand the various components of the power plant, and then interpret that data and apply your understanding to adapt your inputs and achieve the desired result.
Because of Nucleares’s level of depth and intricacy, I have developed this guide to assist you with a basic startup procedure, the steps to meet demand (both up and down), and then the steps to safely shut down the plant. Note that all the numbers I give here are examples. There is no “right way” to do any of this, and you may find as many different methods are there are Nucleares players. I am demonstrating one method—my method—and know that your plant may behave differently, because even timing plays a role in all this.
With that said, let’s begin with a basic startup. I will provide my startup checklist and then list it again with explanations of the “what” or “why” behind the steps.
**Note that this guide is designed to be used with starting fuel and equipment, the chemicals modules add-on turned OFF, and just one loop installed.

Detailed Startup - Pre-start

1. ACTIVATE all terminals
If you chose the option “skip the startup…” then all the terminals will already be activated and this step is not necessary.
2. External power: ON
Again, if you chose to “skip the startup…” then you will already be on external power. Otherwise, you are likely running off your backup generators. External power has the benefit of not causing integrity loss to the generators (caused by normal usage over time) and not having to pay for generator fuel. External power costs 10 prestige points per day, but certain event may cause external power to be unavailable.
3. Generators: MANUAL and STOP
If you “skipped the startup…” then once you activate external power you need to manually turn off your generators (STOP button). If you do not switch it from AUTOMATIC to MANUAL, your generator will just start back up again. The generators automatically start any time you are not generating internal power at the turbines.
4. PZR thermostat: ON
This is the automatic control for the pressurizer heater.
5. PZR heaters: ON
This begins the process of heating the water in the pressurizer, raising the pressure, and, in turn, increasing the pressure necessary in the internal core for normal operation. This process takes a long time so it is better to start it early.
6. Condenser vacuum: ON
The condenser needs a vacuum to ensure the steam returning from the turbines is pulled through and no backpressure is created. This takes time to build, but not nearly as much as the PZR.
7. Resistor bank: ON
One of the two easiest ways to damage and destroy an electric generator is not utilizing a resistor bank. The Resistor banks absorb all the energy being generated by the turbogens as they spin up.
- Verify Bypass set to 000
Bypass deflects a percentage of steam coming from the steam generators away from the turbines. We want to ensure that 100% of the steam makes it to the turbine, so we need to double check that the Bypass is set to 0.
- Verify MSCV set to 000
The MSCV allows steam to leave the steam generator toward the turbines. Setting the MSCV to 0 allows the pressure to build more quickly so we can control the release, pressure, and volume.
-- Once Core Vessel Pressure ≥ 150bar –
The pressure within the core needs to reach a proper temperature before we continue, otherwise steam may develop in the system, causing potentially catastrophic consequences.
6. Operating mode: NOMINAL
We cannot insert the fuel into the core unless we are in NOMINAL, or “normal running,” mode.
7: LOAD fuel
There are two places where fuel can be located within the reactor. When a fuel block is loaded, it is placed into the upper chamber of the reactor and isolated from the core. It is inert here and considered safe. It can be removed out of the reactor or inserted into the inner core. The other location is within the inner core. Once inserted into the inner core, the “seal is broken” on the fuel and it becomes reactive and can generate heat. By default, when starting a new game, the fuel block is pre-loaded into the reactor in the upper, isolated chamber. We must insert it into the inner core when we are ready.
8: Primary pump: ON; set to 15
The primary pump provides a small amount of cooling and is responsible for carrying heat from the core to the steam generators. We start the primary pumps at this stage to begin the transfer of heat as soon as possible, and so that we don’t forget it later among the rush of other tasks.
9. Condenser pump: ON; set to 001
The condenser is the tertiary cooling loop and responsible from delivering heat from the reactor to the external cooling towers, where it is eventually released into the atmosphere. It has a very strong effect and we only need it set to 1 to begin.
- Verify Condenser vacuum = 100 (optional: Condenser vacuum: OFF, if = 100)
This step verifies that the vacuum has fully formed before we begin the reaction within the core. Once the vacuum is established it is perpetual and the vacuum pump may be turned off.
Detailed Startup - Start Reactor & Connect to Grid
10. Control rods: SET to 93
This step begins the reaction within the reactor core. The number we select indicates what percentage of the control rods are inside the core and functioning. The smaller the number, the less percentage of the rods are inside the core, and the more the fuel will react and create heat. A number above 93 will cause the core to heat slower, and a number below 93 will cause the core to heat faster.
-- Once STG pressure ≥ 60 bar –
We then watch our steam generator pressure. The steam generator temperature will rise as the core temperature increases and the primary pump transfers the heat. Once the steam generator temperature reaches 100°, water within the steam generator boils and steam begins to form. The more water is boiled, the more steam is present; the coolant (water) volume within the steam generator will drop and the pressure will rise. Once the pressure within the steam generator reaches 60 bar, we are ready to release the built up pressurized steam to the electric turbines.
11. MSCV: set to 5
The main steam control valve works as an aperture and permits the escape of steam from the steam generator to the turbines (the steam spins the turbine which spins the generator which creates electricity). If the MSCV is opened too much, there is no back pressure and the release of steam is inefficient (like trying to spin a fan by blowing on it with your mouth wide open). If the MSCV is set too low, not enough steam is being released.
12. Secondary pump: ON; set to 25 (SLOW)
The secondary pump is responsible for replenishing the water boiled off as steam within the steam generator. It carries the cooled water from the condenser to the steam generator to be boiled and turned to steam again.
13. Request STARTUP from city
This is done through the tablet (TAB key) and then the communications button. We must notify the city that we are ready to generate power and connect to the power grid. Once we make the request, it takes the city 10-15 minutes to respond to us. The city approves the next hour after responding for startup. Example: If we make the request at 9:40, the city will approve us to connect at 10:00. If we start the request at 11:55, the city will respond within the 12:00 and approve us to connect at 1:00. The first hour approved (10:00 – 11:00 and 1:00 – 2:00 in our examples) is not counted. On the demand board, in green letters, will be the word STARTING. We will be able to connect to the power grid during this first hour, but will not be rewarded with any prestige points for doing so. Likewise, if we fail to connect until the very end of the hour, or miss it altogether, we will not be penalized. After the first hour (at 11:00 and 2:00 in the examples given) we are able to earn prestige points. The goal is to be connected to the power grid by the end of the hour the city approves us to connect.
Because the spin-up of the electric turbines takes so long, we request it at this point to give us time to rev up, connect, and meet demand on time. Be strategic with when you request the startup. It will take some getting used to.
-- Once Turbine RPM ≥ 3050 RPM –
Nothing on the turbine panel should be touched until the turbine’s RPMs are above 3050. They will stop climbing at 3052. Closing the circuit or pressing the green excitation buttons or the blue RPM buttons will negatively affect the turbines and may cause them damage (and more work for you once they are spun-up).
14. Utilize Synchroscope; stop dot in middle top position at 3060 RPM
Use the red RPM buttons to stop the moving red dot at the 12-o’clock position on the synchroscope. The moving dot will become green once it is stopped in the right location at the right RPM (3060)
-- Once dot is GREEN –
If the dot is at the 12-o’clock position, you may need to move it off and back again.
- Verify SYNC = GREEN
This is  a small, squarish indicator at the bottom of the panel with a light below it. Do not close the circuit until this indicator switches from RED to GREEN.
15. Circuit breaker: CLOSE
This is the step that closes the contact and connects the electric generator to the city’s power grid.
16. Adjust primary pump, secondary pump, and MSCV as necessary
Adjust for demand (see next section)
17. External Power: OFF
We no longer need external power from the city since we are creating our own. You can actually turn this off much earlier in the startup sequence, once the turbines begin spinning up and are creating at least 500kW.
18. Backup Generators: AUTOMATIC
This step ensure that, in the event of a loss of internal power, the backup generators will automatically start up without you having to do it manually.

Meeting Demand

The power the city requires from the power plant is shown in the red rectangle labeled BUS. The green rectangles to the left of BUS are how much power each generator is creating. On the far right is a red rectangle showing how much power is being delivered to the city. This number is derived from taking total power generated, minus what is being used by the plant, minus any power being diverted to the resistor banks.
The goal is to turn off the resistor banks and raise/lower your output to meet the city’s demand. The city will absorb up to 10% over their request and you are considered compliant if you produce at least 90% of the demand (over the course of the hour).
The main way of increasing or meeting demand is through the MSCV. Changing the MSCV up or down by 1 will generally raise or lower the power output by 4MW. Opening the MSCV (higher number) allows more steam out of the steam generator and closing the MSCV allows less. When more steam is released (higher MSCV value), more water must be brought in from the condenser to replace the boiled-away water. This is done with the secondary pump.
Typically, with starting basic equipment and fuel, your MSCV to secondary pump speed ratio is 5:1. Meaning, if your MSCV is set to 6, your secondary pump speed should be set to 30 (6 x 5 = 30). If the MSCV is 3, your secondary pump should be 15 (3 x 5 = 15). This is what brings your steam generator into thermal balance—the steam being boiled off is being replaced by new water from the condenser at the exact same rate it is boiled; there is no net gain or loss of the water level. This is verified through the Coolant Inlet and Steam Outlet digital readouts. Coolant Inlet is mainly controlled by the secondary pump speed and the Steam Outlet is mostly controlled by the MSCV setting.
If Coolant Inlet = Steam Outlet, then the system is in thermal balance. If Coolant Inlet > Steam Outlet, more water is coming in than steam is exiting, and your steam generator coolant level will slowly rise. If Coolant Inlet < Steam Outlet, less water is coming in than steam is exiting, and your steam generator coolant level will slowly fall.
Using the equipment the game starts you out with, the Coolant Inlet readout is typically twice your secondary pumps speed. Meaning, if you set your secondary pump to 35, the Coolant Inlet should eventually read 70 (it is not instant and takes time to climb/descend after changes are made). If your secondary pump is set to 15, your Coolant Inlet will read 30.
The Steam Outlet should be 10x your MSCV setting. If you set your MSCV to 3, your Steam Outlet should read 30; if set to 5, the readout should be 50. If the readout is NOT 10x the MSCV setting (for example, you set the MSCV to 7 but the readout stops climbing at 64), then you do not have enough heat to generate the necessary steam to reach that output. In that case, you would either increase the primary pump speed or the temperature of the core.
When set up properly, if your MSCV is set to, say 5, then your secondary pump should be set to 25 (5x the MSCV setting), and your Coolant Inlet and Steam Outlet readouts should both be 50. If you need to produce more power output to meet demand, raise the MSCV by one, raise the secondary pump by 5, and wait. If your Steam Outlet does not reach the expected number, try increasing the primary pump.
Note that higher condenser temperatures, higher primary pump speeds, and higher core temperatures will all raise power output independently of MSCV & secondary pump settings, and vice versa (lower temps/speeds will lower output). You can strategically use this to your advantage.
If you need to lower your output to meet demand, step your MSCV down by 1, your secondary pump down by 5, and then monitor the readouts. You may be able to lower the primary pump speed slightly to help bring the output down by 1-2 MW as necessary.

Shutting Down

Conceptually, different things are happening during a shutdown that are not related to each other but will affect each other. We shutdown the turbine, we cool off the core, and we cool down and manage our steam generator volume level.
The first step in performing a shutdown is to request the shutdown from the city and then wait until a time is given. With startups, the city approves the startup for the very next hour. With shutdowns, the city approves shutdowns AFTER the next hour. Meaning, if you request a shutdown at 9:20, the time they will come back with is likely 11:00. If you request a shutdown at 2:56, they city will likely respond in the 3:00 hour and your shutdown time will be 5:00. But the time works similarly (but inversely) to the startup. That last hour, ending with the time the city gave you, is not counted for or against you. Example, you request a shutdown at 10:06. The city responds at 10:18 and says your shutdown is approved for 12:00. This means that you are not required to meet demand from 11:00 – 12:00; you may begin the shutdown process starting at 11:00 (after you finish meeting demand for the 10:00 hour). You will not gain any prestige points for meeting demand from 11:00 – 12:00 (in our example).
There are times that the city will deny your request to shut down. This is especially true if an audit has already been scheduled. The city cannot deny an emergency shutdown, but an emergency shutdown will automatically trigger an audit (in Normal difficulty mode).
Once you are in your shutdown hour (the hour leading up to the shutdown time provided by the city), the green words SHUTTING DOWN will appear on your demand summary board. It is now time to continue with the shutdown process.
Step two, change the plant operating mode to SHUTDOWN.
Step three, turn your resistor banks on.
Step four, after requesting, receiving, and reaching the shutdown time from the city, is to open the circuit on the turbine. This must be done first because spinning down the turbine while connected to the power grid will cause damage to the turbine and can destroy it.
Next, fully insert control rods. This stops the reaction in the core and instantly begins cooling.
Switch your backup generators to MANUAL and activate external power (if you do not have external power available, start the backup generators now and leave on manual mode).
Then, and only after opening the turbine circuit, open the bypass valve to 100. This begins the process of spinning down shutting down the turbine and electric generator.
Note that you do not have to, nor should you, wait for the bypass to actually reach 100. The same goes for all the following steps. Set it and move on to the next one.
Next, open the MSCV valve to 100. This begins lowering the pressure in the steam generator and, because our bypass is already on its way to 100, will send the steam back to the condenser.
Step nine, set your primary pump speed to 50. This will help cool the core faster.
Ten, set your secondary pump speed to 25. As your steam generator begins cooling, the secondary pump pulls more water in from the condenser. Having the steam generator too full can hamper restart efforts later.
Step eleven, increase condenser speed to 25. This helps cool the secondary steam generator a bit quicker.
Once your steam generator temperature is below 100°, turn your secondary pumps off.
Once the core temperature is below 50°, turn your primary pumps off.
Turn your condenser pumps off.
The biggest thing to watch during the shutdown process is the steam generator coolant level. For the startup method listed above, it is important for the steam gen coolant level to be at 50,000. If it is higher or lower than this, you will likely run into problems during restart. Even once your secondary pump is off and spins down to 0 (the pump takes time to spin down to fully stop at 0 and, while it is spinning down, it will continue to pump water), the volume will continue to rise. This is because steam within the system is cooling and condensing back into water and finding its way back into the steam generator. It is always possible to drain or fill the steam generator (Evaporator Drain Valve or secondary pump), but this may be something to watch for. If there is still pressure in the steam generator, condensing is still taking place. You can vent off the last bit of pressure and stop the condensation filling quickly by opening the steam generator steam vent valve (green switch).
I recommend setting your steam generator coolant level back to 50,000 for restart. Note that the water level in the external core pool must be below 50% to access the fuel hatches. Only once the core temperature is below 50° and the plant is in SHUTDOWN mode can AO perform core maintenance tasks.
Also, you cannot remove fuel blocks until they have less than 30% fissionable material left. You can find how much material your fuel has left in the preventative maintenance report near the bottom.
